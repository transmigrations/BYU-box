**Bob's your Uncle box is an enclosure for ASIC miners**


ASIC miners are sometimes very noisy in an indoor setting and there is an added issue of dust and heat that needs to be managed. 
There are a few ways to manage these issues, like immersion tanks and underclocking the miner. In this guide we will look at BYU (Bob's your Uncle) box, which is CNC machined plywood box that dampens the noise and also manages the temperature.

Before we go any further lets talk about an enclouser called DIY BlackBox (as the BYU box design is derivied form it). 

BlackBox has been commericially produced by Steve Barbour of the https://upstreamdata.ca and the DIY version of the BlackBox has been developed by econoalchemist https://www.econoalchemist.com/, who has an extensive guide on GitHub (https://github.com/econoalchemist/UpstreamData-DIY-BlackBox.git) on how to build your own.

The panels on the BYU box are designed to be cut on a CNC router, the desgin files for these panels can be sent to a local CNC router cutting shop that can cut the plywood to size. Once you have the required pieces the assembley can be done easily by using a mallet. The only other material you will require to complete the box, is soundproofing/noise absorbing material.

The indepth guide by econoalchemist is really useful in understanding how the box works, the reasons why the box was designed in such a way, along with the material used, so please check the above link to the guide.

Below are the .DXF files that the CNC router will require to cut the pieces.

That is it, Bob's your uncle.
